/**
 * Implementation of Spring's HTTP Client API over Apache
 * HttpComponents/client.
 *
 * There's very little to say here; the chief entrypoint is
 * {@link org.dthume.spring.http.client.httpcomponents.HttpComponentsClientRequestFactory}.
 * After that, consult the HttpComponents/client documentation.
 *
 * @see <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/http/client/package-summary.html">
 * Spring HTTP Client API</a>
